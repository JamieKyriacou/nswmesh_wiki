title: Sydney Meshcore Network
---

The Sydney Mesh Users Group uses the ANZ configuration as a baseline, but with one important modification: we run at Spreading Factor 11 instead of the standard SF10.

This choice reflects Sydney's unique geography and the wide spacing of our users. SF11 provides improved range and stronger links across the metropolitan area, though it does mean our network is not directly interoperable with standard ANZ meshes running on SF10.
